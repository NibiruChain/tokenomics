# Matrix DAO - NEO Tokenomics

Tags: Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, Cosmos, Stablecoin, Tokenomics 

Description: TODO

**Matrix DAO** will be respondible for deploying new stablecoins, accepting new collateral types for a given stablecoin and protocol upgrades and integrations. 

NEO is the decentralized governance token of the **Matrix Protocol**. In other words, NEO tokens give holders the right to participate in governance votes with the **Matrix DAO**, which manages the protocol with a **split of 75% to the community, 15% to the core Matrix Protocol development team, and 10% to early backers**. 

A portion of the collateral from users minting stablecoins 

and from  NEO protocol owns some of the collateral from users that mint stablecoins owns some of the liquidity

## Token Distribution

The NEO token distribution has been modeled to ensure both the short and long-term success of the protocol and its community. With an **intial supply of 1 billion**, the mission behind NEO will be make governance for the protocol much more active and decentralized, to help the protocol control a portion of its reserves, and incentivize both users and [Matrix Liquidity Providers](blog-post-matrix).

| Split (%) | Group | Description |  
| :---: | :----: | ---- | 
| 40 | Community | NEO Liquidity Mining Program on Osmosis |
| 20 | Community | Treasury controlled through Matrix DAO | 
| 15 | Community | Strategic partners, project advisors, and community members that contribute a lot to the protocol   | 
| 15 | Core | Core NEO Team | 
| 10 | Early Backers | TODO desc. | 

## Community Liquidity Mining Program

40% of the NEO supply (400M tokens) will go to liqudity mining incentives over a period of 10 years on Osmosis. These would be distributed to stable holders through staking contracts, to Insurance Agents, and to LPs of AMM pools involving whitelisted tokens of the protocol.

The NEO distribution is modeled after Bitcoin mining, except that instead of halving every 4 years, NEO's distribution would diminish every week. This is implemented using a multisig held by NEO's Core Team.

Each week, some tokens will be distributed to each group with an allocation size determined by governance. The objective of this portion of the treasury is to incentize early users and new participants over the long-term while avoiding short-term mercenary capital.

## Matrix DAO Treasury

At launch, Matrix DAO will manage 20% of the NEO supply, empowering the community to decide where NEO rewards are allocated. Upon activation of governance, the Core Team will sell large a portion of tokens against UNEO via a **bonding curve** so that the protocol can accumulate surplus, control some of NEO's reserves, and deflate the total stablecoin supply (in the event of a black swan scenario).

The Core Team's bonding curve is an exponentially increasing function depending on how many tokens have been sold. It has the potential to revolutionize the way protocols fund themselves and own liquidty. Insted of selling tokens against another curve, the bonding curve sells governance tokens against a token of the protocol, giving the Matrix DAO 

## Core Team

15% of the token supply goes to NEO's Core Team. They will be subject to 3-year vesting, where 2% of this 15% (0.3% of the total supply) will be made available on release, and the remaining tokens will vest linearly. The goal of this scheduling is to keep a meaningfully incentivized yet non-controlling core development team that is still fully commited to the protocol and community long-term.

### Early Backers

The Core Team is expected to raise funding using 10% of the tokens for early backers. This funding goes toward the recruitment of top tier talent payment for extensive security audits.
